# Enhanced OSP (One Shot Protection)

A simple mod that allows you to:

- Set the invincibility window granted by OSP. (default setting is 0.5s, Vanilla is 0.1s)
- Set the threshold of missing HP required before a player loses OSP. (default is 0.1, or 10% missing HP, same as Vanilla)
- Set whether sources of maxHP reduction such as Shaped Glass negatively impact OSP. (default is false, Vanilla is true)

You can reach me (Varna) in the [RoR2 modding discord](https://discord.gg/5MbXZvd) with any feedback!
