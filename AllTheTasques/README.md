# ALL THE TASQUES

Simply adds all the different variants of [NSFWTasque](https://thunderstore.io/package/TheBreadMan/NSFWTasque/) to your character select, instead of just one. Using [ScrollableLobbyUI](https://thunderstore.io/package/KingEnderBrine/ScrollableLobbyUI/) highly recommended.

The original author of [NSFWTasque](https://thunderstore.io/package/TheBreadMan/NSFWTasque/) is hard to find, so I made this small mod to override his configs. It took me four hours because IL is a bunch of bullshit. This will absolutely break if the author ever updates their mod. Don't @ me if/when that happens. Make the bread man add better configs instead.
